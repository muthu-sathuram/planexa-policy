# Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE) Prevention Policy for Planexa

**Effective Date:** 01-October-2024
 
At **Planexa**, we are committed to creating a safe environment for all users, especially protecting minors from any form of child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE). We are dedicated to preventing any illegal activities and ensuring that our app is a safe space for everyone. This policy outlines the preventive measures, reporting mechanisms, and enforcement actions we take to address CSAE on our platform.
 
## 1. Preventive Measures

We employ a variety of measures to prevent the occurrence of CSAE on our app, including:

- **Age Verification:** Users must confirm their age during registration to ensure that children are not exposed to adult content or inappropriate interactions. 

- **Content Moderation:** Our app uses a combination of automated and manual content moderation to detect and prevent any abusive, harmful, or inappropriate content related to CSAE. We rely on advanced AI tools to identify and flag potentially harmful images, videos, and text content.

- **User Behavior Monitoring:** We monitor user activity for signs of inappropriate behavior, including grooming or solicitation. Our system flags suspicious interactions for further review.

- **Clear Terms of Use:** We have clear guidelines on acceptable conduct, including a strict prohibition of CSAE-related activities, harassment, or exploitation. All users must agree to these terms upon registration.
 
## 2. Reporting CSAE Concerns

We take CSAE concerns very seriously. If you encounter content or behavior that you believe violates our child safety standards, we encourage you to report it immediately. To report any CSAE concerns, please follow these steps:

- **In-App Reporting:** You can report any suspicious content or behavior directly from within the app. Simply go to "Report" button at the top and fill out the form with as much detail as possible. Our team will investigate all reports promptly.

- **Contact Email:** For urgent concerns or if you are unable to report via the app, please contact us at info@planexa.ca. We will respond within 48 hours.

- **External Support:** If you believe that the matter requires legal action or is an emergency, please contact local law enforcement immediately. You can also report CSAE content to the [Canadian Centre for Child Protection](https://www.protectchildren.ca).
 
## 3. Moderation and Enforcement

Once a CSAE-related report is made, we follow a clear process to ensure that appropriate actions are taken:

- **Investigation:** All reports will be investigated by our moderation team within 48 hours. We will take appropriate steps to verify the authenticity of the report.

- **Consequences:** If a user is found to have violated our CSAE prevention policies, we will take immediate action. Depending on the severity of the violation, actions may include:

  - Temporary suspension of the user’s account

  - Permanent ban of the user’s account

  - Reporting the user to law enforcement (in severe cases)

- **Collaboration with Authorities:** We cooperate with law enforcement agencies in cases of suspected CSAE and will provide necessary information when required.
 
## 4. User Education and Resources

We believe that education plays a vital role in protecting children online. We encourage users to educate themselves about CSAE prevention and report any concerns they may have. Additionally, we provide resources to help users understand the importance of online safety:
